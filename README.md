## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/probiruk/arxiv-explorer.git
cd arxiv-explorer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **API**: arXiv API
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## How It Works

### Semantic Search

The search functionality uses a combination of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and semantic similarity to rank papers based on relevance:

1. **Term Frequency**: Measures how frequently a term appears in a document
2. **Inverse Document Frequency**: Measures how important a term is across all documents
3. **Semantic Similarity**: Considers context and meaning beyond exact matches
4. **Score Normalization**: Converts raw scores to percentages for easy understanding

### Paper Ranking

Papers are ranked using multiple factors:
- Query term matches in title and abstract
- Category relevance
- Publication date (when sorting by date)
- Author matches (for author searches)
